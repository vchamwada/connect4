# Connect4 webapp.

This is a React-based implementation of the classic game Connect 4. The game is played on a grid of 6 rows and 7 columns. The objective of the game is to get four pieces of the same color in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

To start the game, simply run the app by typing 
#`npm start` 
in the terminal. The game board will appear on the screen, with the status bar indicating which player's turn it is. The first player will be assigned the color red, and the second player will be assigned the color yellow.

To make a move, simply click on any of the empty cells in the column of your choice. The piece will fall to the lowest empty cell in that column.

The game will end when a player gets four pieces in a row or when the game board is filled completely. If the game ends with no winner, the status bar will display "It's a draw!".

To reset the game for a new round, click the "New Game" button at the top of the screen.

Have fun playing Connect 4!
